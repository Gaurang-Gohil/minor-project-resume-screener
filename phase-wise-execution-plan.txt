Phase 1: Frontend Development (Week 1-2)

Step 1: React Application Setup
- Initialize React Project: Create a new React app with TypeScript for better type safety
- Install Core Dependencies:
  - react-dropzone for multi-file drag-and-drop uploads
  - react-doc-viewer for document preview functionality
  - axios for API communication
  - react-bootstrap for responsive UI components

Step 2: File Upload Interface
- Multi-File Upload Component: Implement drag-and-drop functionality that accepts both PDF and DOCX files
- File Validation: Add client-side validation to ensure only PDF/DOCX files are accepted
- Progress Indicators: Display upload progress and file processing status
- Batch Upload Management: Allow recruiters to upload multiple resumes simultaneously

Step 3: Filter Interface Design
- Job Description Input: Create a rich text editor or simple textarea for job requirements
- Skill Filter Module: Implement multi-select dropdown for specific skills filtering
- Project Title Filter: Add search functionality for project-based filtering
- Results Dashboard: Design a clean interface to display ranked candidates with scores

Phase 2: Backend API Development (Week 2-3)

Step 4: Cloud Storage Integration
- AWS S3 Setup: Configure S3 bucket for secure resume storage with proper access controls
- File Upload Handling: Implement secure file upload endpoints with virus scanning
- Storage Organization: Create folder structure based on job postings or upload batches
- Metadata Management: Store file metadata (upload date, file type, processing status)

Step 5: Gemini API Integration
- API Setup: Configure Google AI Studio API key and initialize Gemini Pro client
- Resume Parser Service: Create service to extract text from PDF/DOCX files using libraries like PyPDF2
- Structured Data Extraction: Use Gemini to parse unstructured resume text into JSON format
- Batch Processing: Implement queue system for processing multiple resumes efficiently

Step 6: AI Analysis Engine
- Resume Parsing Workflow: Extract candidate information (name, skills, experience, education, projects)
- Job Matching Algorithm: Compare resume data against job description requirements
- Scoring System: Implement 0-100% matching score based on skills, experience, and project relevance
- Ranking Logic: Sort candidates by match score and filter criteria

Phase 3: Cloud Infrastructure and Automation (Week 3-4)

Step 7: AWS Architecture Setup
- Compute Resources: Deploy EC2 instances or use AWS Lambda for serverless processing
- Database Setup: Use RDS or DynamoDB for storing candidate data and job descriptions
- API Gateway: Configure AWS API Gateway for secure API endpoints
- Load Balancing: Set up Application Load Balancer for high availability

Step 8: Automation Pipeline
- Event-Driven Processing: Use AWS EventBridge or SQS for automated resume processing triggers
- Background Jobs: Implement asynchronous processing for large batches of resumes
- Notification System: Set up email/SMS notifications for completed analysis
- Error Handling: Implement retry mechanisms and failure notifications

Step 9: Security and Compliance
- Data Encryption: Enable encryption at rest and in transit for sensitive resume data
- Access Control: Implement IAM roles and policies for secure cloud resource access
- GDPR Compliance: Add data retention policies and candidate data deletion options
- Audit Logging: Track all resume processing activities and user actions

Phase 4: Integration and Testing (Week 4-5)

Step 10: End-to-End Workflow
1. Resume Upload: Recruiter uploads multiple resumes through React interface
2. Cloud Storage: Files are securely stored in S3 with unique identifiers
3. Automated Processing: Lambda functions trigger Gemini API calls for text extraction
4. AI Analysis: Gemini analyzes resumes against job description and scoring criteria
5. Results Display: Frontend receives ranked candidates with detailed match insights

Step 11: Filter Implementation
- Job Description Matching: Real-time filtering based on job requirements input
- Skill-Based Filtering: Dynamic filtering by specific technical and soft skills
- Project Experience: Filter candidates based on relevant project titles and descriptions
- Combined Filters: Allow multiple filter combinations for precise candidate selection

Step 12: Performance Optimization
- Caching Strategy: Implement Redis for frequently accessed candidate data
- API Rate Limiting: Respect Gemini API rate limits with proper queuing
- Batch Processing: Optimize for handling 50+ resumes simultaneously
- Error Recovery: Implement retry logic for failed API calls

Phase 5: Production Deployment (Week 5-6)

Step 13: Production Setup
- CI/CD Pipeline: Set up automated deployment using GitHub Actions or AWS CodePipeline
- Environment Configuration: Configure staging and production environments
- Monitoring Setup: Implement CloudWatch for application and infrastructure monitoring
- Backup Strategy: Automated backups for resume data and analysis results

Step 14: User Experience Enhancements
- Real-Time Updates: WebSocket connections for live processing status updates
- Export Functionality: Allow recruiters to export filtered results to CSV/Excel
- Candidate Profiles: Generate detailed candidate summaries with key highlights
- Comparison View: Side-by-side comparison of top candidates
